  abstract = {In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a poor link between antibiotic policies and 
  practices exists. Numerous contextual factors may influence the degree of antibiotic access, appropriateness of 
  antibiotic provision, and actual use in communities. Therefore, improving appropriateness of antibiotic use in 
  different communities in LMICs probably requires interventions tailored to the setting of interest, accounting 
  for cultural context. Here we present the ABACUS study (AntiBiotic ACcess and USe), which employs a unique 
  approach and infrastructure, enabling quantitative validation, contextualization of determinants, and cross
  -continent comparisons of antibiotic access and use. The community infrastructure for this study is the INDEPTH
  -Network (International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health in Developing 
  Countries), which facilitates health and population research through an established health and demographic 
  surveillance system. After an initial round of formative qualitative research with community members and 
  antibiotic suppliers in three African and three Asian countries, household surveys will assess the appropriatenes
  s of antibiotic access, provision and use. Results from this sample will be validated against a systematically 
  conducted inventory of suppliers. All potential antibiotic suppliers will be mapped and characterized. Subsequent
  ly, their supply of antibiotics to the community will be measured through customer exit interviews, which tend to
  be more reliable than bulk purchase or sales data. Discrepancies identified between reported and observed 
  antibiotic practices will be investigated in further qualitative interviews. Amartya Sen's Capability Approach 
  will be employed to identify the conversion factors that determine whether or not, and the extent to which 
  appropriate provision of antibiotics may lead to appropriate access and use of antibiotics. Currently, the study 
  is ongoing and expected to conclude by 2019. ABACUS will provide important new insights into antibiotic practices
  in LMICs to inform social interventions aimed at promoting optimal antibiotic use, thereby preserving antibiotic 
  effectiveness.},
